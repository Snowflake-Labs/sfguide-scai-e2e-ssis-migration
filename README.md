## Source SQL Server database

The source workload is the fictional **Tasty Bytes** global food truck network: localized menus, customer loyalty, order management, inventory tracking, and employee scheduling. The DDL deliberately uses T-SQL constructs (computed columns, `ROWVERSION`, `MONEY`, `NTEXT`, `UNIQUEIDENTIFIER`, NOLOCK hints, GLOBAL cursors, etc.) that surface SnowConvert EWIs during migration.

To deploy the SQL Server sample database, run the following scripts in order against your SQL Server instance:

1. `source_db/00_ddl.sql` — creates the `TastyBytesDB` database, the `TastyBytes` and `etl_results` schemas, and all tables, views, user-defined functions, and stored procedures.
2. `source_db/01_data.sql` — populates the tables with sample data in dependency order.

## Snowflake target

On the Snowflake side, only run `snowflake/init.sql`. It uses `ACCOUNTADMIN` to create:

- The `tastybytesdb` database with `tastybytes` and `etl_results` schemas
- The `XSMALL_WH` warehouse
- The `TASTYBYTES_MIG_POOL` compute pool used by the data migration job

## ETL (SSIS) packages

The `etl/` folder contains the source SSIS packages used in the migration walkthrough:

- **`daily_sales_agg.dtsx`** — Reads completed orders from `TastyBytes.OrderHeader` / `OrderDetail`, aggregates daily revenue and order counts per truck, and writes the rollups to a reporting table. Brackets the run with `start execution` / `endexecution` markers in `etl_results.etl_logs`.
- **`update_truck_inventories.dtsx`** — Iterates over operational food trucks, applies inventory adjustments based on recent orders, and updates `TastyBytes.Inventory` (quantity on hand, last restocked, reorder triggers).

These `.dtsx` files are the inputs migrated by SnowConvert AI to equivalent Snowflake-native ETL.
